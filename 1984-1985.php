			<h2>People of China: Photos by Lee C. Lee</h2>
			<p><span class="date">February 1 - February 27, 1985</span></p>
			<p>Lee C. Lee (or Lee Charlotte Lee) was not only an artist but a pioneer of Asian American studies. The first woman professor of Asian ancestry at Cornell University, she helped initiate the institution’s Asian American Studies program, which was the first of its kind on the East Coast. Lee was known for her passion towards student needs, children’s welfare, and especially the cross-cultural issues between Americans and Asians. Her work is informed by such causes. </p>

			<h2>Emily, Anna & Ti Shan: the First Generation</h2>
			<p><span class="date">March 8 – April 5, 1985</span></p>
			<p>These three artists together signify a direction Asians in America have come to take. All born and raised in the United States with little or no contact with their Asian heritage, they partake in a very American tradition of painting, yet add something unique of their own. Their works and styles bear many differences but are alike in their meditative tone. Curated by Robert Lee. <i>Learn more: <a href="http://artasiamerica.org/documents/943/156" target="_blank">catalog</a>, <a href="http://artasiamerica.org/documents/1334/156" target="_blank">press release</a>.</i></p>

			<h2>Triangular Landscapes</h2>
			<p><span class="date">April 12 – May 10, 1985</span></p>
			<p>These three young Asian American women bring a particular sensibility to the man-made object and its accompanying space. Drawing upon both Asian and American traditions and employing man’s tool of geometry, the artists create unique and unusual works. “…Awesome powers to plan, manipulate, and control the natural environment…contrast sharply with the Chinese conception of a primal timeless landscape…” Quote by Robert Lee. </p>

			<h2>Dreams and Fantasies</h2>
			<p><span class="date">May 17 – June 14, 1985</span></p>
			<p>In the work of Paul Wong, Helen Oji, and Ming Fay, nature is openly celebrated. Their dreams and fantasies are expressed by novel imagery, which releases a psychic drive, a source of energy and inner joy, an unhibited power contemporary society has sought to control, to hide, and even to deny. Something elemental, hidden from conventional pretenses that has eluded contemporary men and women, is expressed here. Essays by Barry Schwabsky and Robert Lee. Curated by Robert Lee. </p>
