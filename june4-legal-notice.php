    <h2>2014 Important Notice to Artists</h2>
    <p>Dear Artists,</p>
    <p>
      It's been 25 years since the student uprising in Tiananmen Square and the exhibition AAAC mounted in response. Your participation was essential to that effort and your artwork helped to express the strength and character of those of us who wanted to stand with the students. Political crisis abound in modern times yet this confrontation resulted in a unique artistic event with the power to communicate years after its original impact. AAAC is still committed to keep as much of the original exhibition in tact so that people in China may one day see this historic exhibition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The world has moved on but, for those who remember, Tiananmen Square was the precursor to what happened in Hungary, in the former Czechoslovakia and then the break up of the Soviet Union. For several weeks the faces of the students were playing on everyone's TV, a daily daytime drama till it built to a climax before a global audience. An unspeakable spectacle unfolded touching the hearts and minds of people everywhere. People were involved and artist commitments reflected them, magnifying their outcry in vivid, powerful art forms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Art, in this exhibition, transcended the gallery and spoke in the political square. This exhibition demands to be seen and heard. Visions, metaphors and symbols encapsulate Tiananmen Square, so the public can see past the politics to the meaning portrayed and crafted in the crisis moment. Such is the power your art brought to this post modern moment, historically unprecedented.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, tangible evidence including this exhibition will present itself before the eyes of the people of China. Groups such as the Tiananmen Mothers are waiting for this. They are fighting for their loved ones and for justice for all that have occurred since 1989. They want: an accounting of what happened and whose responsible, recognition for their children, reparations and justice for all the repeated injustice inflicted by the government. To resist enforced amnesia, expose the truth and bring justice to the Tiananmen Mothers is to undo the basis for so much of the corruption that is flourishing today. China can still be changed. To remember June 4, 1989 AAAC again asks for your help. Now in 2014 we ask you extend your support to the Tiananmen Mothers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Asian American Arts Centre wishes to thank you for your donation to this effort. Five years ago for the twentieth anniversary of Tiananmen Square our web page marking that moment was mounted. This included a legal notice stating that artists wishing to have their artwork returned should make all such requests during the following month. Many artists at that time were notified by mail of this legal notice. We received only one response. One of the many artists who chose to tke their artwork back, an artist who moved to California drove back to New York City with her original door on the roof to donate it to AAAC.
    </p>
    <p>
      In light of this, those artists who donated their artwork to AAAC twenty-five years ago we thank you. Those artists who donated their artwork five years ago we thank you as well. Those artists who are only now made aware of this notice should realize any claims on the artworks should have been made (5) years ago during the month following AAAC's legal notice in 2009. At this time all works remaining in the possession of AAAC are the property of the Asian American Arts Centre, Inc. which shall be deemed as an unrestricted gift with transferred title, for the Centre's own use and benefit. However, this notice expresses the AAAC's diligence to retain and expand all artists support in this matter. Please contact Robert Lee in regards to any questions or grievance you may have in this matter. (AAAC 111Norfolk Street NYC 10002)
    </p>
    <p>
      Please contact us also if you wish to volunteer, if you have a way to enhance this effort, or if you have special skills that you can offer. Monatary donation are gladly accepted at http://www.artspiral.org/donate.html-please tell your friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further, the Centre wishes to reiterate all artworks may be protected by copyright and other restrictions in favor of parties other than the Centre and should not be copied or otherwise reproduced except as otherwise permitted by the United States Copyright Law.
    </p>
    <p>
      AAAC's purpose remains unchanged, to keep as much of the original exhibition in tact so that the people in China may one day see this historic response of artists joining together, expressing the support of people in the US and people globally, as represented by this exhibition, for the people of China, their struggles and their dreams.
    </p>

      With Kind Regards,
