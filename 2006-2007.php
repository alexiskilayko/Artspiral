			<h2>THREE WOMEN: Art and Spiritual Practice</h2>
			<p><span class="date">September 22 – November 3, 2006</span></p>
			<p>All art to some extent, lays claim to concerns of the spirit. For some artists, however, spiritual issues occupy a central concern, some indicate another realm or existential plane, others are based on access to esoteric knowledge and posit this in their work. The art making practice of these three women is affected by such beliefs as well as the mental states and artistic recipes that have evolved for them as individual personalities, coming to bear fruit with the fragrance of each art work created. Such art intimates a disclosure – that this life is staged in the context of a larger mystery and mundane habits and occurrences can be transformed by the light of this mystery. Curated by Robert Lee.</p>

			<h2>Fracture Fairytales: The 16th Annual Exhibition</h2>
			<p><span class="date">December 8, 2006 – January 19, 2007</span></p>
			<p>Through a review of the Asian American Artists Slide Archive's previous year's submissions, artists are selected by a panel.  This year five artists were chosen who reflect a nexus of themes around personal icons - fantasy, dreams, pop culture, identity & appropriation.  In a complex society with multiple contradictory interests at work, the drive to encompass these through creativity is a sustaining mark of these artist's works. </p>

			<h2>Chinese Classical Architecture</h2>
			<p><span class="date">December 18, 2006 – March 16, 2007</span></p>
			<p>Artistic ornamental color painting on architectural structures shows the unique spirit and concept of China's classical building - an architectural culture of ornamental art. This art form first appeared on buildings during the Spring and Autumn Period (770-220 BC).</p>
			<p>The architectural ornamental art displays the beauty of Chinese folk art and high traditional culture as these have continuously influenced each other. Embedded in this ornament we can become aware of a collage of the many dimensions, and overlapping layers that integrate structural form with non structural elements of color, symbols, rebus art and pictorial imagery.  Principles of Fung Shui, Chinese philosophical notions, even Chinese medicine, are thoroughly embedded in traditional architecture and its orientation in space.  Multi-facet symbolism in design and motifs point to a way of life at peace with nature and natural processes, from which the contemporary goals of a sustainable society can learn.</p>
			<p>The organizer and researcher,  Ms. Chen Xiaorui, is a partner and Senior Designer of the China Architect Engineering and Consulting Company based in Beijing.</p>

			<h2>Mid Career: Bing Lee & Bovey Lee  </h2>
			<p><span class="date">March 30 – May 11, 2007</span></p>
			<p>The eighth installment in the Mid Career series. Bing Lee’s pictographs are an ever-growing series of intuitively generated calligraphic entities, drawn with ink and/or graphite on squares of rice paper.  Lee mirrors the poetic, visual & logical basis of the Chinese written language, while the inspirations for his images or discipline stem from a wide variety of sources.  Lee sites a childhood interest in cartoons, Chinese Opera, urban media, Hong Kong street culture, and American popular culture that flooded Hong Kong. </p>
			<p>Bovey Lee’s paintings and drawings depict floating and weightless objects, flying in transitional modes and planes, visual metaphors for her experiences of displacement and confusion as a recent immigrant. Since 1995, Bovey has used digital media to deconstruct and reconstruct her body into new landscapes. Bovey’s web-based work explores themes of emerging technology, de-humanization of the body and the moral issues surrounding the fabrication of multiple identities in cyberspace.   </p>

			<h2>Mixed Skin</h2>
			<p><span class="date">June 1 – July 13, 2007</span></p>
			<p>In this age of mixing cultural identity and ethnicities, how do we define ourselves? In "Mixed Skin," artists of mixed Asian descent & mixed African roots examine this question. Through interviews with people of mixed descent, Dorothy Imagire, an artist of Japanese and Iranian descent, created  a visual metaphor for the question with individual garments that blend  fabrics from different cultures. Accompanying her unique kimonos are books of personal quotes.  Kip Fulbeck's Hapa Project involves several hundred people: Fulbeck photographs those who identify as Hapa (or those who are partially Asian) and asks them to write about themselves. His performances and slide shows are similarly focused.  Toni Thomas does quilted imagery from her researches on the history of Chinatown in Newark NJ where some interracial marriages have been found.</p>
			<p>Organized by Robert Lee and Vikki Law, essays by Teresa Kim & Albert Chong.</p>
