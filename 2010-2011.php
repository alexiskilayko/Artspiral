			<h2>Infinite Mirror: Images of American Identity</h2>
			<p><span class="date">January 25 – March 20, 2011</span></p>
			<p>The Infinite Mirror exhibition, sponsored by Artrain in conjunction with Brandywine and in partnership with International Arts & Artists, began its exhibition tour at Syracuse University. Infinite Mirror explores America’s image of itself through 65 diverse works of paintings, prints, photographs and video by 40 artists. Utilizing portraiture and figurative images, the exhibition tells the story of an array of triumphs, tragedies, relationships, and traditions that inform our notions of nationhood. The artwork is personal, reflective, and often autobiographical.  Curators are: Blake Bradford, director of education at the Barnes Foundation, Philadelphia; Robert Lee, executive director of the Asian American Arts Centre, New York; and Benito Huerta, associate professor & director of the Gallery at the University of Texas at Arlington. Asian American artists included are: Tomie Arai, Sung ho Choi, John Yoyogi Fortes, Eunjung Hwang, Indira Johnson, Swati Khurana, Kakyoung Lee, China Marks, Chunwoo Nam, Tara Sabharwal, and Scott Tsuchitani. Infinite Mirror traveling was scheduled through 2015. <i>Learn more: <a href="http://www.artrainusa.org/exhibitions.asp" target="_blank">Artrain</a>, <a href="http://www.brandywineworkshop.com" target="_blank">Brandywine</a>, <a href="http://www.artsandartists.org/exhibitions/infinitemirror.html" target="_blank">Infinite Mirror</a>.</i></p>

			<h2>The Art of Danny Yung</h2>
			<p><span class="date">April 16, 2011</span></p>
			<p>AAAC presented Danny Yung, introducing him, his Tian Tian Xian Shang blank boy canvas figure, and his book on Experimental Theatre.  Having been honored with UNESCO’s International Theatre Institute award in 2008, as well as honored by Germany as one of three top students for cultural exchange between Hong Kong and Germany, Danny Yung is widely acknowledged as an art pioneer. He is particularly influential for his work in encouraging the next stage of the evolution of Chinese Opera and the fresh development of Asia’s traditional arts. (Largely unknown - he is the seminal figure in founding Basement Workshop in 1970 in NY Chinatown.) Held at NYC Asian American Student Conference (NYCAASC). <i>Learn more: <a href="http://artspiral.blogspot.com/2017/04/danny-yung-blank-boy-community-event-in.html" target="_blank">blog 1</a>, <a href="http://artspiral.blogspot.com/2014/07/danny-yungs-flower-plaque-installation.html" target="blank">2</a>, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/asianamericanartscentre/4229707066/in/album-72157622978683669/" target="_blank">photograph</a>.</i></p>
