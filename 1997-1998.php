      <h2>Paper Deities in New York: Beliefs and Legends of China</h2>
      <p><span class="date">January 30 – early March, 1998</span></p>
      <p>Selections from the Permanent Folk Art Collection of AAAC. An introduction to the Paper Deities of China and their relationship to the Chinese American community in the United States. In Chinese communities throughout the world today, these deities can be found with fresh fruit, incense, and liquor as offerings in their alter.  In the vivid language of a mythology fraught with significance, they stand silently in the background as the unspoken faith that serves to keep the memory of Chinese ideals alive.  The pantheon of these courageous and noble characters are exemplary spirits in a resilient, ongoing historical process, abundant in role models that for centuries among the common people, framed Chinese thought and culture. NY Flushing Council on Culture and the Arts. Performances by Chen Guo and Wang Chang Yuan.</p>

      <h2>Silk Light: Four Artists From Korea</h2>
      <p><span class="date">May 22 – June 20, 1998</span></p>
      <p>The works of these four Korean artists together exhibit one facet of Korean contemporary art and help uncover a relationship to the artistic situation of Asian Americans. The Korean phrase, “Working In Silk Robes In the Evening Moonlight,” provokes, in the original Korean, the passion and futility of the artistic impulse in the absence of the beholder. Such is the situation here. Such is the situation of Seoul, Korea. Guest Curated by Choong Sup Lim.</p>

      <p><span class="date">June 26 - July 26, 1998</span></p>
      <p>This exhibition is an opportunity to open a dialogue between these two artists and their work.
