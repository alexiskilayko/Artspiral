			<h2>Nuo Masks</h2>
			<p><span class="date">November 28, 2007 – March 10, 2006</span></p>
			<p>The Nuo ritual has been practiced in China since primitive times over four thousand years ago. Ritual "Nuo" masks may be the only living art tradition linked historically to the Bronze Age of China. The origins of Nuo culture in Zhejiang province can be traced back to the Liangzhu culture of the Neolithic period. Nuo is a form of masked drama. Priests or specially trained shaman-dancers used masks to perform at ritual ceremonies to expell ghosts and evil spirits. Nuo is also a theatrical opera held at festival, aimed to establish ties and norms between heaven and earth, man and gods. Traditionally, following the solemn ritual, the Nuo opera was performed to entertain the spirits. According to Chinese folklore, a street parade of legendary generals and deities could best expel evil from the community.</p>

			<h2>Tibetan Thangka Paintings</h2>
			<p><span class="date">January 2 – March 10, 2006</span></p>
			<p>This exhibition was a part of the AAAC's Lunar New Year festival in 2009. Five traditional artists/crafts people gave demonstrations, including Ye Xun — a Chinese miniature dough figurine artist, Rose Sigal-Ibsen — Sumi-e ink calligrapher, Kavita Vyas — an Indian Mahendi hand painting artist, Duong Truong — fortune teller, Kwok Kay Choey — an Er Hu performer, together with Jampa Youden — a Tibetan folk singing performance. </p>
			<p>At the opening reception, Lama Tenzin presented a talk on the significance of Thangka paintings. Thangka paintings usually depict deities and saints, aspects of the life of the Buddha, as well as the more abstract Mandalas, astrological charts, medical descriptions and scenes, usually serving as a supplementary aid to religious educational development. They are meant as focal elements for visualization, meditation and contemplation.</p>

			<h2>Mid Career: Mayumi Terada & Choong Sup Lim</h2>
			<p><span class="date">May 19 – June 24, 2006</span></p>
			<p>Choong Sup Lim deals with the dichotomies of east/west, interior/exterior, rural/urban, and nature/industry through the contradictions and paradoxes in his work. Forms and materials are carefully selected for their capacity to conjure multiple associations.  He has been working both here and in Korea.</p>
			<p>Since 2001, Mayumi Terada has been building dollhouse-sized interior spaces from balsa wood, Styrofoam and clay, then photographing and enlarging them into large silver gelatin prints. A sense of absence emerges from recent evidence of a presence in these sparsely-furnished rooms.</p>

			<h2>Yoshiki Araki: Hiroshima Born</h2>
			<p><span class="date">July 7 – August 11, 2006</span></p>
			<p>Yoshiki Araki was born in March 1950 in Hiroshima. He was raised by his mother while his father served in the navy and rose to rear admiral. When the bomb fell in Hiroshima, his mother, then a young girl, went into what was left of the city to search for her father.  She never found him. Yoshiki worked a jackhammer in mine for a year to come to the USA, then spent it all in a month.  Yoshiki did make it to New York studying at the Art Students League, living on Amsterdam Ave, in Harlem and later in Brooklyn. In 2000 he was evicted from his home and studio of many years that was filled with his art works and preparations for many more.  Under the stress and tension of trying to find a new space to accommodate all that he had gathered and planned, Araki became ill and had to be hospitalized. He died shortly thereafter. AAAC offers this opportunity to view some of the paintings and sculpture that he left behind.</p>
