			<h2>15th AAAC Annual: Aphasia</h2>
			<p><span class="date">September 23 – October 28, 2005</span></p>
			<p>This exhibition concerns itself more with a variety of subjective and ethnic themes than one overriding motif.  If we look for a common Asian theme in the work of these artists, we will find that the show may seem a bit confused. Several of these artists are similar, however, in their use of digital and mixed new media and of images from commodities, games, and popular interpretations of alien beings. An artists’ talk was held October 2. <i>Learn more: <a href="http://artasiamerica.org/documents/3996/187" target="_blank">flyer</a>, <a href="http://artasiamerica.org/documents/4003/187" target="_blank">press release</a>, <a href="http://artasiamerica.org/documents/4902/121" target="_blank">artist statement</a>.</i></p>

			<h2>Detained</h2>
			<p><span class="date">March 24 – May 5, 2006</span></p>
			<p>An Arab American and Asian American exhibition aimed to bring two communities together around issues of race, exclusion, and spirituality. Chaplain James Yee, born and raised in New Jersey, chose to convert to Islam after serving in the US Army during the Gulf War, several years before being secretly arrested while serving at Camp Delta in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on allegations of espionage. He was detained for 76 days before all criminal charges were dropped. Aside from the issues raised by this incident are the underlying spiritual questions – an American, and an Asian American, graduate of West Point who chose to convert to Islam.  It is this personal narrative that may enable people to relate to each other, not just intellectually with information and knowledge but to see and encounter each other in a different light. Organized by Rabab Abdulhadi, Director, Center for Arab American Studies, University of Michigan, and Robert Lee, executive director of AAAC. Panel talks, etc., are projected with the assistance of the James Yee ad hoc Support Committee. <i>Learn more: <a href="http://artasiamerica.org/documents/2729/126" target="_blank">flyer</a>, <a href="http://artasiamerica.org/documents/2728/32" target="_blank">artist statement</a>.</i></p>

			<p>Sponsored by the artists with support from AAAC, Rebuild Chinatown Initiative, Explore Chinatown Campaign, and Chinatown Partnership LDC. Every evening from 7:30 to 11pm, the façade of HSBC Bank at 58 Bowery near Manhattan Bridge was the site for an interactive art installation.  Silhouettes of pedestrians mix the footage of interior work spaces with time-lapse exterior street images of unique areas that define New York’s Chinatown contemporary work culture.

			<h2>Mayumi Terada / Choong Sup Lim at Mid Career</h2>
			<p><span class="date">May 19 – June 24, 2006</span></p>
			<p>Choong Sup Lim deals with the dichotomies of east/west, interior/exterior, rural/urban, and nature/industry through the contradictions and paradoxes in his work. Forms and materials are carefully selected for their capacity to conjure multiple associations.  He has been working both in the United States and in Korea.  Since 2001, Mayumi Terada has been building dollhouse-sized interior spaces from balsa wood, styrofoam. and clay, then photographing and enlarging them into large silver gelatin prints. A sense of absence emerges from recent evidence of a presence in these sparsely-furnished rooms. Terada has lived in New York City for the past few years, exhibiting in Los Angeles, NYC, Korea, Tokyo and other cities throughout Japan. <i>Learn more: <a href="http://artasiamerica.org/documents/4865/201" target="_blank">flyer</a>, <a href="http://artasiamerica.org/documents/4866/201" target="_blank">press release</a>.</i></p>

			<h2>Yoshiki Araki: Hiroshima Born</h2>
			<p><span class="date">July 7 – August 11, 2006</span></p>
			<p>Yoshiki Araki died in 2000. He was born in March of 1950. His mother, as a young teenager, went into what was left of Hiroshima, the ruins of that nuclear wasteland, to search for her father, last of an old Samari family, but never found him. As a young man Yoshiki did make it to New York studying at the Art Students League,. In 2000 he was evicted from his home and studio in Brooklyn of many years that was filled with his art works and preparing for many more.  Under the stress and tension of trying to find a new space to accomodate all that he had gathered and planned, within a month Araki became ill and had to be hospitalized. He died shortly thereafter. Today we have yet to come to terms with the inhumanity of Hiroshima. In the darkness of that moment, as a second generation survivor, Yoshiki sought its quest in his art. His work may still offer us clues as to a journey we have yet to take. Some of his paintings and sculptures that he left behind is preserved in the AAAC Permanent Collection. Curated by Robert Lee & Sayaka Araki.</p>
			<p>Hiroshima Legacy: The Art of Yoshiki Araki was a panel talk on August 6, 2006, featuring: Jesse Fuchs, artist; Tristan Wolski, artist; Raphael Mostel, Tibetan Singing Bowl Ensemble; Sayaka Araki; Peaceful Tomorrows; September 11 Families; David McReynolds, the War Resisters League; Robert Lee, Moderator.</p>
