      <p><span class="date">October 16 – November 21, 1998</span></p>
      <p>Eighth in a series, this exhibition introduces individuals whose search for an artistic and visual language is the only bond that joins them together.

The exhibition as a whole serves as an introduction to the broad and diverse concerns of artists who together compose a part of the contemporary presence of Asia in America. Organized by Young M. Park, Trinh Le, and Robert Lee. <i>Learn more: <a href="http://artasiamerica.org/documents/2807/45" target="_blank">flyer</a>, <a href="http://artasiamerica.org/documents/2808/45" target="_blank">press release</a>.</i></p>

      <p>An exhibition presenting two artists, Ushio Shinohara and Rocky Kagoshima, as they create their art with the stubbornness of an idea arising directly from their experience of global cultural conflict.

      <p><span class="date">March 26 – May 8, 1999</span></p>
      <p>An exhibition of four artists who each represent different approaches but are similar in that they all share Asia as their point of departure.
