			<h2>Yeong Gill Kim</h2>
			<p><span class="date">July 11 – August 1, 2008</span></p>
			<p>Yeong Gill Kim is a Korean American artist who has lived in NY for many years. He saw the transition in Korea from a feudal society to a modern country and the confusion it brought to the people. By 1995 he had given up purely contemporary idioms and returned to materials and ideas that had inspired so much of Korea's artistic tradition. Inflected by modernity in the uniformity of the color of the strokes, by the washed surface, his gesture to contemporary times is there, and to that extent, to the West. The complexity of his brush work on muslin has attained a breathtaking clarity and simplicity.</p>
