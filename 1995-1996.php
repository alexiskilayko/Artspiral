			<h2>Passion and Compassion: Five Artists Reflections on Buddhism</h2>
			<p><span class="date">January 1996</span></p>
			<p>This exhibition seeks to generate a dialogue by examining a relationship of congruence between a belief in the creative act and Buddhism.  Inspired metaphysical vision touches upon the phenomena of mysticism where the creative act may claim its Epiphany. In this American cultural context artists push the limits of Buddhist vision. To see their art may be to see mundane existence in its most enhanced state, informed by the tradition of Buddhism as it has been transplanted and mediated in a new cultural context.</p>

			<h2>Art & Buddhism Panel</h2>
			<p><span class="list-columns">February 9, 1996</span></p>
			<p>It was the renowned historian, Arnold Toynebee who said that if we looked back at the 20th Century from 200 years in the future, it will be the encounter with Buddhism, not science, that determines the character of our time. His comment contrasts sharply with Pope John Paul whose recent book speaks of Buddhism as negative, constituting a problem for the future. The history of Asians in America reflects this controversy. The well known writer Lawrence Ferlingetti wrote poetically of the fear of a dragon as it danced, escaping from a Chinatown tenement basement, only to return finally to its underground sanctuary.  The resistance to Buddhism as part of an awakened Asian American community is a thread in the story of colonialism that continues today. The effect of a pervasive mass culture has been to discourage if not disenfranchise Asian Americans as well as others from exploring their traditions and beliefs. </p>
