The Asian American Arts Centre was also a past recipient of a 2006 grant from the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation (LMDC) for the creation of the <a href="http://artasiamerica.org">artasiamerica digital archive</a>, a past recipient of NEA and NYSCA Advancement Grants, as well as a recipient of a major research grantee from the Rockefeller Foundation in 1990 and again in 1999. The Art Centre also received a LINK award from the Bronx Borough President's Office for its Arts-in-Education program entitled the "Pointed Brush."
