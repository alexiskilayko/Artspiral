			<h2>Teen Map Project</h2>
			<p><span class="date">November 2008</span></p>
			<p>AAAC Saturday Art School teacher Chi Lee managed and directed 17 teenagers between 18 and 21 years old from all over China at CMP to address the problem of making Chinatown a welcoming place for teens. They planned, researched, compiled agreements with shopkeepers as well as designed together a Map for Teens, locating twenty-two places welcoming teenagers in Chinatown. This was finalized and easily carried by folding into an origami shape. A collaboration between AAAC Saturday Art School & Chinatown Manpower Project (CMP).</p>

			<h2>Clusterbomb! Zero Capital Exhibition</h2>
			<p><span class="date">December 13 – January 15, 2009</span></p>
			<p>Clusterbomb! is a creative response to physical and psychological displacement in the post 9-11 era of disillusionment and inertia.  It is an interdisciplinary, intergenerational and transnational network of artists, writers, activists, cultural workers and youth. Participants are posing a collective challenge to why those who have are getting even more and those who don't have are getting even less, or nothing. A meeting at the closing of artists, stakeholders and interested parties included performances, new works, home cooked food, drinks and a discussion on the future Zero Capital international artists collaborations, events, and fundraising efforts. Artist Tomie Arai distributed signed, audience-selected Free Art chosen at the Opening. <i><a href="http://artasiamerica.org/documents/1357/74" target="_blank">Learn more</a>.</i></p>
