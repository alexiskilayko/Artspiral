      <h2>REAPPEARING EXIT IV: Performance Art of Zheng Lianjie</h2>
			<p><span class="date">March 15 – April 28, 2002</span></p>
			<p>Zheng Lianjie is a New York-based artist originally from Beijing who has been doing performance art since the late 1980's.  His most well-known work internationally, "BINDING THE LOST SOULS: Huge Explosion," done in 1993 was a 17-day performance and installation piece that involved wrapping ten thousand bricks along the Si Ma Tai section of the Great Wall with red cloth ribbons. Zheng and his compatriots recruited from the local rural villagers of Dongpo their assistance in completing this grueling performance. The lives of the villagers, both young and old, bring to contemporary art another dimension, a more wholesome responsibility for a future, and an important critique of international urban culture.  </p>
			<p>Zheng Lianjie emerged from China’s Cultural Revolution a self taught artist.  He is an artist who seeks an enlarged humanity, a radiant soul. In his own words, Zheng Lianjie states: "Enthusiasm and appreciation for the ordinary has given me the chance to examine my own heart…The life and field of vision of avant garde art must pay attention to a broader field and social space. The freedom of an artist to create is no different from the freedom of peasants to own their land.</p>
			<p>Panel discussion: Gao Minglu, Prof. at SUNY Buffalo, Qian Zhijian, Post-doctoral Candidate at the Institute of Fine Arts and Bing Yi, independent curator, Robert Lee, and Zheng Lianjie.</p>
      <p>Curated by Robert Lee.</p>

			<h2>The Players: Asian American Art</h2>
			<p>A conference co-sponsored by AAAC & Asian/Pacific/American Studies Program & Institute at New York University. Held at New York University Main Building, 100 Washington Sq. East.</p>
			<p><span class="date">June 1, 2002</span></p>
			<p>After World War II in the United States of 1945, many artists were challenged by the prospects of the post war years including artists of Asian background. A few, like Yun Gee, were awakened much earlier.  With them began the quest for a contemporary art, an art touched by a complexion all its own, and wrought by hands that imparted a value beyond its modern surface. Asian American Art raises a multitude of questions - the role of past traditions and sensibilities, the issue of quality vs. ethnicity, and the perspective of critical terms like multiculturalism. Such questions mark this stage of Asian American Art History seeking to compliment the fire artists’ passion bring in urging forward the quest.  The significance of Asian American Art is open to discovery.</p>

			<p><span class="date">June 22nd</span></p>
			<p><strong>Panel One: A Role for the Arts in Community Development</strong>. A spirit of Community has shaped many years of Asian Americans activities, particularly not-profit arts and cultural organizations. Will the arts continue to help shape the development of the Asian American community? Will the visible differences of an Asian ethnicity continue to be accepted long term in America?  In the age of virtual technologies, what role exists for local cultural  not-profits and for-profits?</p>
			<h6>Panelists:</h6>
			<ul class="list-columns">
				<li>Robert Lee, AAAC</li>
				<li>Jack Tchen, A/P/A Studies Program NYU</li>
				<li>Lillian Cho, Asian American Art Alliance</li>
				<li>Jan Lee, Sinotique</li>
				<li>Phillip Liu, Community Liaison for C. Virginia Fields</li>
				<li>the Manhattan Borough President</li>
				<li>Steve Yip, Director of Operations at the CHinese American Planning Council</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Panel Two: Funding Art: A Community's Infrastrucuture</strong>. The health and vitality of the spirit of a people is reflected and sustained by the Arts. That’s why in 1965 the National Endowment for the Arts was founded.  However, in 1995, Expansion Arts, that part of the Endowment that supported diverse communities, was eliminated.  What has been the effect on Asian American communities?  What actions if any on other levels of government have been taken to fill the gap that was left.  What is the future of arts funding in regards to diverse community development.</p>
			<h6>Panelists:</h6>
			<ul class="list-columns">
				<li>Nicolette B. Clarke, Exec. Dir of the New York State Council of the Arts</li>
				<li>E’Vonne Colman Rorie, former NEA Expansion Arts Assistant Director</li>
				<li>Lenard Detlor, Director of Program Service, NYC Department of Cultural Affairs</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Selected documents in the document room from 1969 with the beginnings of the Asian American Movement up through to the present, touching upon many key moments, organizations, people, events, and ideas.  A treasure of over forty rare video tapes amplify the documents. For example: the choreography of Eleanor Yung, a 1983 Asian American Artist Panel talk, a 1988 installation by Epoxy, a 1991 interview of four Chinese artists by Alexandra Monroe, Nuo Mask Ritual Theatre in Jiangxi 1992, Eunjin Oh speaking at TAAC (The Assoc. of American Cultures) in 1994 in St. Louis, a 1996 CC Wang interview, a 1997 interview with VC Igarta, The NEA Tapes by Paul Lamarre 2000, Freud: In Search of Chinese Matter and Mind” 2001 By Zuni Icosahedron.  These and other artifacts assembled formed a context for the art works presented.</p>
			<p>Much of the work in selecting and organizing the documents was done with the assistance of an outside research consultant, Young M. Park, who has contributed a critical essay entitled, “The Asian American Arts Centre:  Its History of Reintegration”, dated June 2002.</p>
