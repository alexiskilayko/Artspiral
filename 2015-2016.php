		<h2>Aboveground: 40 Moments of Transformation</h2>
		<p><span class="date">September 23 - 27, 2015</span></p>
		<p>A photography exhibition of young feminist activism in China. Forty specific actions in the struggle for gender equality were presented through a collaboration between China Rights in Action, Feminist Task Force, and Asian American Arts Centre. China's worsening repressive environment, bringing the fight for gender equality above ground comes at great personal risk. This exhibition frames and explores the determination with which these young feminists are pushing for a China with true gender equality. President Xi Jingping spoke on gender equality at the UN on the 27th on his "commitment to action." The Clemente Gallery on Suffolk St was the site of the exhibition and talks.</p>
